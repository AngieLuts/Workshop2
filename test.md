> **git branch** - show  all branches in a selected repository

In  order to create new branch we need to use this command:

+ *git branch  branch_name* - creating new branch

+ *git checkout-b branch_name* - creating&switching at the same moment

In order to delete branch you can use these commands:
 + *git branch -d* - this command checks if the branch was previously merged and then deletes it

 + *git branch -D'* - this command doesnt check merging. It just deletes selected branch
